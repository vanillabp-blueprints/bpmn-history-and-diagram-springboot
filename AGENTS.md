# bpmn-history-and-diagram

Serves the BPMN of a workflow and the elements it has passed, which is what a viewer needs to
draw a running workflow. A delta on top of `module-single`.

Read
[the organisation-wide AGENTS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillabp-blueprints/.github/main/AGENTS.md)
first. It carries the procedure, the reference structure and the list of things never to do.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

|              Name               |                                  Where it occurs                                  |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SendTask_AwaitPartnerApproval` | the BPMN element the workflow waits at and the `@WorkflowTask` method serving it  |
| `historyContext`                | the request parameter of `/definitions` and `/history`, passed through to the SPI |

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical in every
blueprint - copy them unchanged.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Put the three calls into the class which already owns `ProcessService`, next to
   `startWorkflow`. They are outgoing calls like every other one, and they are the reason
   that class exists.
2. Do NOT wrap them in a transaction. They read, they persist nothing and they do not advance
   the workflow.
3. Expose them as they are: the definitions first, because a viewer needs an id before it can
   ask for a diagram; then the XML; then the history.
4. **Treat a process definition id as opaque.** Never parse, shorten or rebuild it. VanillaBP
   prefixes the BPMS' id with the adapter which can resolve it, and a UI carrying it in a URL
   has to hand it back unchanged.
5. Take `historyContext` as an optional parameter on the definitions and the history endpoint,
   even without call activities in the model. It is what lets a viewer dig into a call
   activity later, and adding it afterwards means changing a published API.
6. Assume the history LAGS on a remote BPMS and may be less detailed than you expect. Do not
   build logic on it: it is what a user looks at, not what the application decides by. What
   the application decides by is the workflow aggregate.
7. Do not collect the history yourself. A handler writing "I was here" onto the aggregate
   duplicates what the BPMS already knows and drifts from it the first time a workflow is
   cancelled.

If the process has call activities, follow the `secondaryWorkflowHistoryContext` of an executed
call activity back into `getProcessDefinitions` to show the called model - see
[`bpmn-call-activity-decomposition`](https://github.com/vanillabp-blueprints/bpmn-call-activity-decomposition-springboot).

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster WITH secondary storage and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address`
configured; without secondary storage that adapter reports no element history, which is
documented behaviour and not a defect of the generated code.

`LoanApprovalIT` proves the aspect and has to pass: the definitions of the workflow, the BPMN
behind them, the element the workflow stands at while it waits, and the history of the ended
workflow. Write such a test with a WAIT loop, never with an immediate assertion - a remote
BPMS feeds its history through an exporter, and an assertion which passes on an embedded
engine would fail on the next one.

Do not report success without having run this.
