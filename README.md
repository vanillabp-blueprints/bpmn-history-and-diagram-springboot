# Showing BPMN and execution history

[![Apache License V.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

Sooner or later somebody asks to see the process: the diagram, and on top of it what this
one case has done so far. This blueprint serves both from the application, through three
methods which read and change nothing.

## What this blueprint shows

![The loan approval process, waiting for a partner](docs/loan_approval.png)

The loan approval of the base blueprint with one wait state added, so there is something to
look at while the workflow is still running. Three endpoints answer what a viewer needs:

```
GET /api/loan-approval/{id}/definitions   which process definitions this workflow uses
GET /api/loan-approval/{id}/diagram       the BPMN XML of one of them
GET /api/loan-approval/{id}/history       what this workflow has done, element by element
```

They map one to one onto `ProcessService#getProcessDefinitions`, `#getBpmnXml` and
`#getWorkflowHistory`, and all three live in `Workflow.java` next to `startWorkflow` - the
one class allowed to touch `ProcessService`. They are the only part of the SPI which does not
change a thing: no transaction, no progress, nothing persisted.

**The element ids are the point.** A `WorkflowHistory` holds when the workflow started, when
it ended if it did, and its elements in execution order with their start and end times. An
element which has started and not ended is where the workflow stands, which is what a viewer
like [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io/) colours. Feed it the XML from `/diagram` and the ids from
`/history` and the picture draws itself; this blueprint stops at the API, because a UI is not
what a blueprint should teach.

**A process definition id is opaque.** It looks like something you could take apart, and you
must not: VanillaBP prefixes the BPMS' own id with the adapter that can resolve it, because a
workflow may run in any configured BPMS and `getBpmnXml` has no aggregate to derive one from.
Pass it back exactly as it came.

**Not every BPMS records the same.** Some report every flow node, some only activities, and a
remote engine reports with a delay because its history is fed by an exporter. The test of this
blueprint is written accordingly: it waits for the history rather than asserting it right
away, and it checks that the elements it drove through are in there, not that they are the
only ones. Camunda 8 needs secondary storage for any of this, which its adapter documents.

**Ended workflows can be shown too**, as long as the BPMS still holds them. Once its history
retention cleaned up, `getWorkflowHistory` says so with a guiding
`WorkflowNotFoundException` rather than an empty answer.

## Delta to the base blueprint

Compared to [`module-single`](https://github.com/vanillabp-blueprints/module-single-springboot):

|            File            |                                       What is different                                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `loan_approval.bpmn`       | a task the workflow waits at, so a running workflow has something to show, and a task after it |
| `Workflow.java`            | the three viewer methods next to `startWorkflow` and `completeTask`                            |
| `Service.java`             | passes them through, and says in its log where to look                                         |
| `ApiController.java`       | `/definitions`, `/diagram` and `/history`                                                      |
| `Aggregate.java`           | the id of the task the workflow waits at, so the wait can be answered                          |
| `WorkflowTaskHandler.java` | the `@TaskId` handler of that task                                                             |
| `LoanApprovalIT.java`      | asks what a viewer asks, while the workflow runs and after it ended                            |

The wait state is not the subject here. It exists because a history of a workflow which
finished in twenty milliseconds shows nothing worth looking at. How an asynchronous task
works is
[`bpmn-async-task`](https://github.com/vanillabp-blueprints/bpmn-async-task-springboot).

## Running it

Requires a JDK 21. Camunda 7 is embedded, so nothing else has to run:

```bash
mvn install verify
```

Running it on another BPMS is a Maven profile, not one line of Java changes:

```bash
mvn install verify -Pcamunda8
```

Camunda 8 is a remote engine, so a cluster has to run. It also needs **secondary storage** for
this blueprint: definitions and history are served by the query API, and a cluster without it
reports no element history at all. Start one; its address, and everything else specific to that
engine, lives in its profile file `application/src/main/resources/application-camunda8.yaml`,
with a copy for the module's own test:

```yaml
vanillabp:
  adapters:
    camunda8:
      # Camunda 8 is a remote engine: point this at your cluster.
      rest-address: http://localhost:8080
```

That file is loaded because the Maven profile `camunda8` sets the Spring profile of the same
name, so the engine is chosen once, on the Maven command line, and the build, the tests and
`spring-boot:run` all follow it.

Start the application:

```bash
mvn -pl application spring-boot:run
```

Nothing about identifiers shows up at startup: the BPMS profiles of this blueprint set
`name-clash-avoidance: use-prefix`, so VanillaBP puts the workflow module ID in front of every
identifier before it reaches the engine and takes it off again on the way back. The BPMN files,
the business code and the rest of the configuration keep the plain names, and no tenant is
involved, which matters on a BPMS licensed per tenant. What the modes are and what each of them
costs is in
[the wiki](https://github.com/vanillabp/adapter-platform-integration/wiki/Workflow-modules#how-name-clashes-are-avoided).

This is the URL that starts a loan approval:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/loan-approval/start?amount=5000
```

The workflow then waits, and the log says where to look:

```
Loan approval '4d0e…' waits for the partner. Look at it while it waits:
  http://localhost:8080/api/loan-approval/4d0e…/history
Approve -> http://localhost:8080/api/loan-approval/4d0e…/approve
```

The history of the waiting workflow names the element it stands at, without an end time:

```json
{
  "processDefinitionId": "camunda7:loan_approval:1:8f2c…",
  "startTime": "2026-08-15T15:11:42.531+02:00",
  "endTime": null,
  "elementsHistory": [
    { "elementId": "ServiceTask_RetrieveCreditRating", "startTime": "…", "endTime": "…" },
    { "elementId": "SendTask_AwaitPartnerApproval", "startTime": "…", "endTime": null }
  ]
}
```

The diagram behind it is the BPMN the BPMS holds, which is the model VanillaBP deployed:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/loan-approval/{loanRequestId}/diagram
```

Answer the wait with the `approve` URL and ask again: the last element has an end time, the
task after it appears, and the workflow itself has one.

While the application runs on Camunda 7, Camunda's own web applications are served at

```
http://localhost:8080/camunda
```

Log in with `demo` / `demo`. Cockpit shows the same thing for an operator, which is worth
comparing: this blueprint is about serving it to YOUR users, in your application, without
sending them to the tooling of a BPMS they should not need to know.

The Camunda 8 profile brings neither the dependency nor those settings into effect. Its
tooling is part of the cluster, and the file naming a Camunda 7 adapter id is simply not
loaded there - a profile file applies to its own engine and to no other. Naming an adapter
id whose adapter is not on the classpath is a configuration error VanillaBP refuses to
start with, and the profiles are what keeps that from happening.

## How it works

|                                            File                                            |                                  Role                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.../loanapproval/Workflow.java`                                                           | the three viewer methods, where `ProcessService` is injected           |
| `.../loanapproval/ApiController.java`                                                      | the GET endpoints a UI would call                                      |
| `.../loanapproval/Service.java`                                                            | passes the calls through, without a transaction - nothing is changed   |
| `loan-approval/src/main/resources/loan-approval/processes/<adapter-id>/loan_approval.bpmn` | the process, with one wait state so a running workflow shows something |
| `loan-approval/src/test/.../LoanApprovalIT.java`                                           | asks the BPMS what a viewer asks, while running and after the end      |

The order of events: `getProcessDefinitions` locates the workflow in whichever BPMS holds it
and reports the definition it runs on, `getBpmnXml` resolves an id to its model, and
`getWorkflowHistory` reads the elements. Which BPMS answers is VanillaBP's business, and the
opaque definition id is what carries that decision from one call to the next.

A process with call activities returns more than one definition, each naming the elements
that call it, and the history of an executed call activity carries a
`secondaryWorkflowHistoryContext` to dig one level down. This blueprint has no call activity,
so both endpoints take the context as an optional parameter and pass it on -
[`bpmn-call-activity-decomposition`](https://github.com/vanillabp-blueprints/bpmn-call-activity-decomposition-springboot)
is the model to try that with.
